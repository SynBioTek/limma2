High level goals:
- roxygenise all function documentation
 -test all functions, maybe refactorising
- remove cruft
- add ggplot2 based plotting

A few details:
weighted.median is only called by norm.R.  Test vs. bigvis::weighted.median and consider removing entirely.

auROC isn't called any other functions in limma.  Consider deleting, using pROC::roc instead.

removeExt is weird and doesn't really belong here.  Create path util package and move there.

trimWhiteSpace is just stringr::str_trim. Remove.

There are lots of instances of 1:n, that should be replaced with seq_len(n).
